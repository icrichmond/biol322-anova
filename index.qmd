## Learning Goals

- *Understand* what an ANOVA is 
- *Understand* when/how to use an ANOVA
- *Understand* what a F-statistic is and where it comes from
- *Differentiate* between statistical & research conclusions



## When do I use an ANOVA?

- You have groups! 
- We are explaining <w style = "color: #2c4b27"> *continuous* </w> dependent variables using <w style = "color: #574571"> **categorical** </w> independent variables 
  - i.e., if you want to know if there are differences between more than two <w style = "color: #574571"> groups </w>



## One-Way ANOVAs

:::nonincremental
- One-way = **one**  <w style = "color: #574571"> categorical </w> explanatory variable 
- Statistical test used to compare variation across means of 2+ <w style = "color: #574571"> groups </w>

```{r, echo = F, eval = T, fig.align='center'}
library(ggpubr)
d <- read.csv("presentation_imgs/chap15e1KneesWhoSayNight.csv")
ggboxplot(d, x = "treatment", y = "shift", add = "jitter", color = "treatment", palette = c("#e7ad52",  "#2c4b27", "#574571")) +
  labs(y = "", x = "") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_blank())

```

## History of ANOVAs

::: {layout-ncol=2}
- Invented by Sir R.A. Fisher ("father of modern statistics")
- Used to prove differences between groups to support eugenics (among other things)

## Example - knees are the new eyeballs??

Background: photoreceptor cells influence our circadian rhythm
- traditionally thought that mammals only have these kinds of cells in our eyeballs 
- created an experiment to test if these cells are present behind the knees ([Campbell & Murphy, 1998](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.279.5349.396))

## Part III: Null & Alternative Hypothesis Testing 
- statistical hypothesis testing**
- quantitative approach and practical meaning



## Part V: Demonstrate F-Statistic 
- before explaining equation, show how sensitive the test is using the F statistic (ie penalized for variance)


## Part VI: Variance AMONG MEANS 
- ANOVAs are only variance among means, name is misleading 


## Part VII: F-Statistic Workthrough 
- why is penalization important
- makes sampling error important

## Part VIII: What des data look like in R?


## Part IX: ANOVA code 
- use aov not lm


## Part X: t2 = F for two groups 
- make demonstration via code
- or t = sqrt(F)


## Part XI: Statistical Conclsion of Example


## Part XII: Reporting of ANOVA Tables

** NO ACCEPTING HO** 


## Part XIII: How was F Distribution Built from ANOVA perspective?
- diagram


## Part XIV: ANOVA R output


## Part XV: Automatically one-tailed test bc F is squared


## Part XVI: Statistical Hypothesis Testing -> Research Conclusion


## Part XVII: ANOVA Assumptions
