## Learning Goals

- *Understand* what an ANOVA is 
- *Understand* when/how to use an ANOVA
- *Understand* what a F-statistic is and where it comes from
- *Differentiate* between statistical & research conclusions



## When do I use an ANOVA?

- You have groups! 
- We are explaining <w style = "color: #2c4b27"> *continuous* </w> dependent variables using <w style = "color: #574571"> **categorical** </w> independent variables 
  - i.e., if you want to know if there are differences between more than two <w style = "color: #574571"> groups </w>



## What is an ANOVA?

:::nonincremental
- One-way = **one**  <w style = "color: #574571"> categorical </w> explanatory variable 
- Statistical test used to compare variation across means of 2+ <w style = "color: #574571"> groups </w>

```{r, echo = F, eval = T, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
library(ggpubr)
d <- read.csv("presentation_imgs/chap15e1KneesWhoSayNight.csv")
ggboxplot(d, x = "treatment", y = "shift", add = "jitter", color = "treatment", palette = c("#e7ad52",  "#2c4b27", "#574571")) +
  labs(y = "", x = "") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

## History of ANOVAs

::: {layout-ncol=2}
- Invented by Sir R.A. Fisher ("father of modern statistics")
- Used to prove differences between groups to support eugenics (among other things)

## Example - knees are the new eyeballs??

Background: photoreceptor cells influence our circadian rhythm based on how much light they receive & when

- mammals thought to only have these cells in our eyeballs   
- did experiment to test if these cells are present behind the knees ([Campbell & Murphy, 1998](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.279.5349.396))
- 33 trials of 2 groups: control or experimental (knee)
- found evidence light exposure to knees can change circadian rhythm! But...

## Example - knees are not the new eyeballs! 
- one huge problem in the study highlighted in a rebuttal paper ([Wright Jr. & Czeisler 2002](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1071697))
- initial study did not cover patients eyes during the experiment! 
- new study with 3 groups: control, light exposure with blindfold (knee), light exposure without blindfold (eyes)
- no effect of light exposure to knees
- perfect case for an ANOVA! 



## Example - knees are not the new eyeballs! 

```{r, echo = F, eval = T, fig.align='center'}
library(ggpubr)
d <- read.csv("presentation_imgs/chap15e1KneesWhoSayNight.csv")
ggboxplot(d, x = "treatment", y = "shift", add = "jitter", color = "treatment", palette = c("#e7ad52",  "#2c4b27", "#574571")) +
  labs(y = "Change in Melatonin Phase", x = "Treatment Group") + 
  theme(legend.position='none')
```

## Statistical Hypothesis Testing

Null hypothesis & alternative hypothesis framework:  

- H~0~ = there is no *statistical* significance between the groups 
- H~A~ = there is a *statistical* significance between the groups 
- we either: 
  a) reject the null hypothesis 
  b) fail to reject the null hypothesis (**!= accept**)
- statistical significance != biological significance 



## One-Way ANOVAs

- one-way ANOVAs test if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of 2+ groups using the F-statistic 
- the more different the groups are, the more likely we are to **reject the null hypothesis** and determine them as significantly different

```{r, echo = F, eval = T}




```



## The Sensitivity of the F-Statistic
::: nonincremental
- The F-statistic penalizes for variance **within groups**
  - as variance **within groups** increases, F-statistic decreases even when the **between group** variance is the same

```{r, echo = F, eval = T, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
dat1 <- read.table(text = "info mean sd
group1 10 1
group2 20 1
", header = TRUE)

densities <- apply(dat1[, -1], 1, function(x) rnorm(n = 1000, mean = x[1], sd = x[2]))

colnames(densities) <- dat1$info

#Put into long format
densities.m <- melt(densities)

#Plot
ggplot(densities.m, aes(value, linetype = Var2)) + 
  geom_density() +
  theme_classic() + 
  labs(x = "", y = "") + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none')

```
:::



## The Sensitivity of the F-Statistic

:::nonincremental
- these groups have a lower F-statistic (and therefore are less likely to be statistically significant), even though they have the same means (**between group variance**) as the last slide
  - they just have more **within group** variance
  
```{r, echo = F, eval = T, fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
dat2 <- read.table(text = "info mean sd
group1 10 5
group2 20 5
", header = TRUE)

densities <- apply(dat2[, -1], 1, function(x) rnorm(n = 1000, mean = x[1], sd = x[2]))

colnames(densities) <- dat2$info

#Put into long format
densities.m <- melt(densities)

#Plot
ggplot(densities.m, aes(value, linetype = Var2)) + 
  geom_density() +
  theme_classic() + 
  labs(x = "", y = "") + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none')

## Analysis of Variance (AMONG MEANS)

:::nonincremental
- ANOVAs are only variance among **means**, not variance in general


$$F = \frac{s^2~between~}{s^2~within~} = \frac{\frac{\sum \limits _{i=1} ^{g}  (X~i~-X)^2}{(g-1)}}{\frac{\sum \limits _{i=1} ^{g} (X-X~i~)^2}{(n-g)}}$$
:::



## F-Statistic

:::nonincremental
- Numerator: between group variation **from the global mean**
- need to divide by number of groups (g) because as group number increases, sum of variation will increase 
:::

![Liguori & Moreira, 2018](presentation_imgs/variation.png)


## F-Statistic  

:::nonincremental
- Denominator: within group variation **from the global mean**
- As within group variation increases, F-statistic gets smaller 
  - Penalizes for within group variation
:::

![Liguori & Moreira, 2018](presentation_imgs/variation.png)



## F-Statistic 

- Penalization for within group variation is important because it makes **sampling error** very important

$$F = \frac{s^2_{between}}{s^2_{within}} = \frac{\frac{\sum \limits _{i=1} ^{g}  (\bar X_{i}-\bar{\bar{X}})^2}{(g-1)}}{\frac{\sum \limits _{i=1} ^{g} (X-\bar X_{i})^2}{(n-g)}}$$

#| code-line-numbers: '5,6,7,8,9'

# read in data

## Statistical Conclusion

- We reject H~0~, the groups are significantly different from one another (statistically)
- ANOVAs only tell us if there is a difference, this is the entire statistical conclusion
- We **do not accept H~0~**, we only fail to reject

```{r, echo = F, eval = T, fig.align='center'}
library(ggpubr)
d <- read.csv("presentation_imgs/chap15e1KneesWhoSayNight.csv")
ggboxplot(d, x = "treatment", y = "shift", add = "jitter", color = "treatment", palette = c("#e7ad52",  "#2c4b27", "#574571")) +
  labs(y = "Change in Melatonin Phase", x = "Treatment Group") + 
  theme(legend.position='none')
```



## Reporting ANOVAs
- When reporting ANOVAs we always use a clean and organized table to report the:
  a) sum of squares
  b) degrees of freedom 
  c) mean square
  d) F statistic
  e) p-value



## Reporting ANOVAs


Table 1. ANOVA summary table presenting results from `aov`, testing if mean changes in circadian rhythm are statistically different across treatment groups.
```{r, echo = F, eval = T, out.width='50%'}
library(broom)
library(gt)
d <- read.csv("presentation_imgs/chap15e1KneesWhoSayNight.csv")
d$treatment <- as.factor(d$treatment)
a <- aov(shift ~ treatment, data = d)
broom::tidy(a) %>% 
  gt() %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(sumsq, meansq, statistic, p.value), n_sigfig = 2) %>%
  cols_label(
    term = "",
    sumsq = "Sum of Squares",
    meansq = "Mean Squares",
    statistic = "F",
    p.value = "p-value")
  
```
